# To-Do List Application

## Overview

The To-Do List Application is a simple yet effective command-line tool designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently. Built using Python, this application allows users to create, view, mark, and delete tasks, providing a straightforward interface for task management. The application is ideal for individuals looking to organize their daily activities, track their progress, and enhance productivity.

## Features

### 1. View Tasks
The application provides a clear view of all tasks currently in the to-do list. Each task is displayed with its status, indicating whether it is completed or still pending. The user can easily identify which tasks need attention and which ones have been accomplished. The status is represented with a checkmark (✓) for completed tasks and a cross (✗) for pending tasks, making it visually intuitive.

### 2. Add Task
Users can add new tasks to their to-do list with a simple input prompt. This feature allows for quick entry of tasks, enabling users to capture their thoughts and responsibilities as they arise. The application stores each task as a dictionary containing the task description and its completion status, ensuring that all necessary information is retained.

### 3. Mark Task as Done
Once a task is completed, users can mark it as done. The application prompts the user to select the task they wish to mark, and upon confirmation, updates the task's status. This feature not only helps in tracking progress but also provides a sense of accomplishment as users see their completed tasks accumulate.

### 4. Delete Task
If a task is no longer relevant or needed, users can easily delete it from their list. The application prompts the user to select the task they wish to remove, ensuring that only the intended task is deleted. This feature helps maintain an organized and clutter-free to-do list, allowing users to focus on what truly matters.

### 5. User-Friendly Interface
The command-line interface is designed to be user-friendly, with clear instructions and prompts guiding the user through each action. The menu-driven approach simplifies navigation, making it easy for users of all technical backgrounds to interact with the application.

## Technical Details

The To-Do List Application is implemented in Python, utilizing basic data structures such as lists and dictionaries to manage tasks. The application runs in a continuous loop, displaying a menu of options until the user chooses to exit. Error handling is incorporated to manage invalid inputs gracefully, ensuring a smooth user experience.

### Code Structure
- **show_menu()**: Displays the main menu options to the user.
- **view_tasks()**: Lists all tasks along with their completion status.
- **add_task()**: Prompts the user to enter a new task and adds it to the list.
- **mark_done()**: Allows the user to mark a specific task as completed.
- **delete_task()**: Enables the user to remove a task from the list.

## Installation and Usage

To run the To-Do List Application, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can clone the repository from GitHub and run the script in your terminal or command prompt. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/todo-list-app.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd todo-list-app
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python todo.py
   ```

Once the application is running, follow the on-screen instructions to manage your tasks.

## Future Enhancements

While the current version of the To-Do List Application is functional and user-friendly, there are several potential enhancements that could be implemented in future versions:

- **Persistent Storage**: Implementing a database or file storage system to save tasks between sessions, allowing users to retrieve their lists even after closing the application.
- **Task Prioritization**: Adding the ability to assign priority levels to tasks, helping users focus on the most important items first.
- **Due Dates**: Allowing users to set due dates for tasks, providing reminders and enhancing time management.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Developing a GUI version of the application for users who prefer a more visual approach to task management.

## Conclusion

The To-Do List Application is a practical tool for anyone looking to improve their task management skills. With its simple interface and essential features, it serves as a great starting point for users to organize their daily activities effectively. Whether you are a student, a professional, or anyone in between, this application can help you stay on top of your tasks and boost your productivity.
